# N body simulation project for CSC_3S005_EP

## Prerequisites

Input data:

- The description of $N$ bodies $b_1,\ldots,b_N$: mass $m_i$ (in kilograms, kg), initial coordinates $x_i,y_i$ (in meters, m), initial velocity $u_i,v_i$ (in meters per second, m\*s^-1). Apart from the number of bodies, each data point is optional and will be randomly initialised if not given (or set to 0 if only velocity is not given).
- The time (in seconds, s) each time step (or frame) takes. Longer times will result in much faster calculations but likely more innacurate ones.
- The number of time_steps to simulate.
- The number of threads.

The force two bodies $b_i, b_j$ excert on each other is given by the formula:
$$F_{ij} = \frac{G m_i m_j}{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2}$$
where $G$ is the gravitational constant (equal to 6.6743 Ã— 10^-11).

Two matrices on the heap:

- The "Force" matrix, is a triangular/symmetrical matrix which stores at position $i, j$ the force (in Newtons, N, kg\*m\*s^-2) body $i$ exerts on body $j$. Position $i, j$ is further subdivided into two parts, for the force in the $x$ direction and the force in the $y$ direction.
- The "All_Positions" matrix, is a matrix which stores at position $i, j$ the position of body $j$ at time step $i$, which is further divided into $x$ coordinate and $y$ coordinate.
The "Body" instances are also stored on the heap.

## Distributing the work

There are 3 main parts:

- _Main Thread_: Create threads and synchronize threads as well as save the results.
- _Force Calculation Threads_: Assign from the Force matrix a small chunck to each thread. Each thread then calculates the forces required for its chunck.
- _Body Calculation Threads_: Each thread is assigned a certain number of bodies. For each body, calculate its new velocity by summing the forces on the corresponding row of the Force matrix, then update the body's position and velocity.
